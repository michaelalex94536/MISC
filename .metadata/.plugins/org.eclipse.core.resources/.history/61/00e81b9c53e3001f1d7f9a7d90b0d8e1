/**

	Configure the black pill clock without using HAL.  After reset, the clock will bt at its default value - 16 MHz.  We
	want to modify this value.  One trick is to open STM32CubeMX and see how the clock gets configured there for starters -
	why not?  Let's set the clock to its maximum value of 100 MHz,

	The HSE on the board runs at 25 MHz and is connected to pins PH0 and PH1. To get a 100 MHz system clock, the PLL settings are:
	/ M = / 12, * N = X 96, and / P = / 2 where X = multiply and / means divide.

Procedure:
1) Enable HSE.
2)
